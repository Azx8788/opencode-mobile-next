#   0. the proposed change class (informational, never fails; docs/release/change-classes.md);
#   1. commit rules and dart format of the changed Dart files (G33);
#   2. generated localizations match the ARB files (gen-l10n leaves no diff);
#   3. flutter analyze;
#   4. the QA tool unit tests (Python);
#   5. the repo-scanning Flutter tests (ledgers, ratchets, manifests, glossary).
# It changes nothing in the worktree except regenerating lib/l10n output, and
# says so when that output was stale.
